# Excel Formula Extractor ðŸ“Š

This tool is designed to extract formulas, constants, and exceptions from an Excel workbook, in this case specifically designed for the file _PB-berekeningen.xlsx_. It provides insights into the calculations made within the workbook, aiding in analysis and understanding. It extracts formulas, and writes them in a more readable, standard syntax, all combined in one file.

The idea is to summarize and analyse complex and long excel files withouth having to click through all the involved cells manually!
